Hi there! 👋 I'm a passionate problem solver, focused on building efficient, clean, and simple solutions. My journey in programming is driven by a love for tackling challenges, creating robust software, and constantly improving my craft.

On this GitHub profile, you'll find a variety of projects that span across C++, Assembly, and more. From class-based systems to low-level optimizations, I've tackled a broad range of topics, always aiming to enhance my problem-solving abilities and my understanding of how things work under the hood.

🚀 Featured Projects
📅 DateTime Class
Developed a custom DateTime class for manipulating date and time data (year, month, day, hour, minute, second) with precision and immutability. Implemented subtraction operations that respect the integrity of original objects.
🔢 Sequence Class
Built a Sequence class to generate and manipulate sequences based on user-defined patterns. Supported operators like ++ for increments, and designed it to handle complex data generation formulas efficiently.
⚖️ Rational Numbers (Rational Class)
Created a Rational class to handle basic arithmetic on fractions. Ensured immutability of the objects while performing operations like addition and subtraction to maintain clean and reliable results.
🔳 SparseVector Class
Implemented a SparseVector class that efficiently represents and performs arithmetic operations on sparse data, ensuring zero elements don’t get removed unnecessarily during operations.
🏈 Fantasy Football League System
Built a football simulation system managing Player, Team, Season, and Award classes. Features include tracking player stats, calculating team leaderboards, and handling game results dynamically.
🎮 Color Challenge Game (Colorch)
Designed a color-matching game where players use balls to clear a board, implementing mechanics like shifting and inserting balls to meet certain conditions.
🛠️ Assembly Programming Projects
Explored Assembly language through practical programs involving word and vowel counting in files, string extraction, and sorting algorithms like bubble sort—all built from scratch, no external libraries allowed.
🏆 Football Simulation & Awards System
Developed an award distribution system for football seasons, based on player performance and game stats, integrating dynamic leaderboard calculations.
🛠️ My Approach
I believe in building from the ground up, prioritizing simplicity, and making sure every line of code serves a purpose. Here’s what drives my development:

Minimalism: I prefer to use simple, direct solutions over complex libraries or tools. This approach allows me to focus on the core concepts and ensures that the code remains as lean and efficient as possible.

Immutability & Integrity: In most of my class implementations, I ensure that objects remain immutable during operations. This design choice promotes reliability and avoids side effects.

Low-Level Optimization: I love diving deep into low-level concepts like memory management and assembly programming. Writing efficient code that works seamlessly is a challenge I embrace fully.

No to Bloat: I avoid unnecessary dependencies or built-in functions (e.g., std::string functions, iostream in certain cases). This keeps my projects lightweight and forces me to think creatively.

🌱 Why GitHub?
I use GitHub to showcase my journey, to learn from others, and to share my progress. By collaborating on open-source projects and contributing ideas, I hope to keep evolving as a programmer. I'm always open to feedback, and I'd love to connect with fellow developers who share a passion for building things from the ground up.
